								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>
									Hello! I'm Aset, an 18 year old passionate learner looking into the field of IT. I recently graduated from Western Governors University with a Bachelor's in Cloud Computing. My time spent at WGU taught me a lot about information technology and equipped me with knowledge I am ready to apply in my career.
								</p>
								<p>
									What first got me in love with information technology was the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification. At this point, I was still a tech novice, but it gave me a glimpse of what cloud computing was like. After this, I began to study more, do more hands-on, and enroll in WGU. Now, I'm proud to say that not only did my skills grow, but my passion for the field is still strong and continues to drive me forward.
								</p>
								<p> 
									I am currently unemployed but applying for jobs in the information technology field. Since I am not employed, I spend my free time reading up on AWS documentation and embarking on new projects. That way, I will have hands-on experience that will transfer into what I will do in a job.									
								</p>
								<p>
									I love learning new things and continually seek ways to improve my skills. I am deeply passionate about IT, so studying for certifications and working through projects is fun. I look forward to putting my knowledge to use in the real world!

								<h3>Cloud Resume</h3>
								<p>This website is proof of this project! This is my rendition of the Cloud Resume Challenge using Amazon Web Services. Through this project, I demonstrated my experience integrating AWS technologies using a CI/CD pipeline, source control, and infrastructure as code. I also implemented API integration and grew my knowledge in coding in HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. The project is on my GitHub <a href=https://github.com/vvgeneral>here</a>. 
								</p>
								<h3>Python Russian Roulette</h3>
								<p>My biggest Python project so far simulates a Russian Roulette text-based game and has a test for the code as well. It was this project that made me grow to like Python so much. This helped me learn a lot about Python, and I plan to do more in the future. You can find the project on my GitHub <a href=https://github.com/vvgeneral/pythonprojectrr>here</a>.										</p>
								<h3>AWS Control Design</h3>
								<p>I love cloud computing and cybersecurity, so this project is an implementation of a secure cloud environment. In this project, I was able to implement a NIST 800-53rev5 compliant environment by using AWS services. It taught me much about least privilege and best practices like secure credentials. I documented this project as well on my GitHub <a href=https://github.com/vvgeneral/AWS-Control-Design-Workshop>here</a>.</p>
								<h3>AD Home Lab</h3>
								<p>I wanted to get more experience with VMWare and Active Directory, so I made this project! In this project, I created a virtual environment comprised of a Windows Server 2019 domain controller VM and a Windows 10 VM, all running on VMWare. I configured things like DHCP, DNS, and NAT on the domain controller as well as created users using a PowerShell script. I go more in depth on the architecture and what I did <a href="https://github.com/vvgeneral/ADHomeLab/">here</a></p>
